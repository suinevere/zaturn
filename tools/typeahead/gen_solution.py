"""Generate a compiled typeahead "solution" overlay from winning walkthroughs.

The runtime builds the grammar layer (verb->preposition, verb->object class) for
whatever game is loaded. This overlay adds the "easy mode" refinement on top:
base completion weights from word frequency, and context transitions from command
word-bigrams, biased toward the winning path.

Each game is identified by its Z-machine *release number* + *serial* (from the
story header at 0x02 / 0x12), so an overlay only applies to the exact story it was
built for. Words are emitted in the runtime's own spelling (dictionary full-word
recovery), so they resolve against the trie the device builds.

Input (per game): a walkthrough text file -- one command per line, '#' comments.

Usage:
  python gen_solution.py \
      --game ../../saturn/cd/data/Z3/ZORK1.Z3:ZORK1.WIN \
      --out  ../../saturn/src/typeahead_solution.c
