 | app_state.h
 | Description: The cross-cutting runtime globals shared across the interpreter's
 |   modules -- persisted game options (difficulty, audio levels/mix, display
 |   palette, online dial number), save/restore session state (pre-picked and
 |   last-used slots, the queued auto-command), the soft-reset jump target, the
 |   story file in play, and the console scroll position. Housing g_scroll here
 |   (rather than in the input or console_view module) avoids a mutual
 |   input<->console_view header cycle: input writes it, console_view reads it,
 |   and this header is neutral C-safe ground both can include. Declarations
 |   only -- definitions live in app_state.cxx.
