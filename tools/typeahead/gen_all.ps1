# Regenerate the per-game "solution" overlay for ALL games into ONE C file.
#
# Why one file, not one-per-game:
#   * The typeahead DICTIONARY + grammar is decoded at RUNTIME on the Saturn
#     (build_typeahead_from_story in typeahead_extract.c), for any v3 game. The
#     old gen_typeahead.py baked table (build_zork_typeahead) has no callers --
#     it is dead. So there is nothing to generate per game for extraction.
#   * The solution overlay (gen_solution.py) emits a single apply_solution_overlay
#     plus a SOLUTIONS[] table keyed by each story's release number + serial
#     (Z-header 0x02 / 0x12). At load, the runtime picks the row matching the
#     loaded game -- that IS the dynamic wiring. Emitting one file per game makes
#     every file redefine apply_solution_overlay/SOLUTIONS -> link collisions.
#
# Run from tools/typeahead/ :  ./gen_all.ps1
# Then rebuild:               cd ../../saturn ; ./compile.bat
